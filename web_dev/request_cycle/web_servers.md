1. Linux is open source which means it's freely available for anyone to download
   and modify. 
   The creators of Linux assume the user is computer literate. This means
   the operating system allows users to do anything, bad or good, 
   no matter if it was intentional or unintentional.

2. A VPS is essentially an operating system in a cloud. It's a computer
   that you physically can't see, but can use and manipulate from the
   terminal. The pros seem to be that the cost is very little, and it's 
   easy to maintain as long as you know what you are doing. The cons seem 
   to be that you can open yourself up to a security threat. 

3. When you're logged in as the root user, you can cause damage that you
   can't undo. When you're logged in as a non-root user, you can be
   sure that you probably can undo any damage. Also, as a root user,
   you're leaving your login exposed to threats like viruses. 


RELEASE 2
1. onvolumechange is a property that I would like to play with.
   I think it does what it says. When the client changes the 
   volume, the page rerenders and does something. 
   A second property would be the title. You could easily 
   change the title.
   Similarly, you can change the text content. Instead of
   a blank text box, you could have it populate with a counter
   of how many people are on the page now.
   Another property I'd like to change is the onhover. I know it's
   something you can do via stylesheets, but I would be interested to
   see how you can do it with javascript.
