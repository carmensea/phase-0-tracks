    My Best Friend, Mogli
    </h1>
      <p>I have the best dog in the universe. That's a pretty <strong>tall</strong> order; but I guarantee I'm telling the truth.</p>

      <p>I love and adore him for <em>many</em> reasons. I'll list a few below: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>He is a cuddle-bug.</li>
          <li>He loves to go for walks.</li>
          <li>He's vocal when he wants to be</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Mogli is also incredibly intelligent. He  knows the following: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sit</li>
          <li>Stay</li>
          <li>Drink water</li>
          <li>Are you hungry?</li>
          <li>Do you want to go for a walk?</li>
        </ol>

      <p>I'm sure some of you are cat people, or you just don't see what's so great about Mogli.</p>


      <p>I have one last point to make.</p>
